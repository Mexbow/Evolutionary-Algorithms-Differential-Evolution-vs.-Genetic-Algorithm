# 🔬 Evolutionary Algorithms: Differential Evolution vs. Genetic Algorithm
This project implements and compares two powerful evolutionary optimization algorithms: Differential Evolution (DE) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Both algorithms are applied to a suite of benchmark functions including:

🌀 Ackley

🏔️ Bukin

✖️ Cross-in-Tray

🌊 Drop-Wave

🍳 EggHolder

Each function is visualized in both 2D and 3D with the best solution found by each algorithm plotted on the surface. The goal is to showcase the behavior and performance of DE and GA in continuous, non-linear optimization tasks.

✅ Features
Differential Evolution (DE) implementation

Genetic Algorithm (GA) with crossover, mutation, and roulette selection

Optimization over 5 well-known benchmark functions

2D & 3D visualizations using Matplotlib

Python & NumPy based

📊 Output
Prints best fitness per generation

Visualizes best solution found by each algorithm on each function
