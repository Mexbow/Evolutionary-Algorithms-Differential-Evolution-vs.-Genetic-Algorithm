# 🔬 Evolutionary Algorithms: Differential Evolution vs. Genetic Algorithm

This project implements and compares two powerful evolutionary optimization algorithms: **Differential Evolution (DE)** and **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**. Both algorithms are applied to a suite of benchmark functions to explore their performance in solving complex, non-linear optimization problems.
